The saves the game gives you are base64 encoded, zlib compressed data
that is broken up into a number of sections.

The sections seem to be separated by the bytes [TAB] [7] 01, IDK what
the significance of that is.

Apart from the header, all other sections are grid layers, which are
lists of columns, where all columns start with the bytes [TAB] [Y] 01,
again I have no idea why.  Columns are made up of cells, which are
usually 1 byte long, but sometimes take up 2 bytes for mysterious
reasons.  See below.

Header:

    This section is 4 bytes long and just holds the dimensions of the
    grid.

    Byte 1: 04? Left sideline width maybe????
    Byte 2: Width, including sidelines
    Byte 3: 04? Right sideline width maybe???
    Byte 4: Height

Layer 1: silicon

    In this layer, the cells are all two bytes wide for some reason.  As
    far as I can tell the first byte in a cell is always 04 and is never
    used.

    Second byte: 00 (no silicon), 01 (N-type), 02 (P-type)

Layer 2: metal

    Cells (usually) 1 byte long: 02 (no metal), 03 (metal)

    This layer is a bit weird though because when there are vias, cells
    expand to 2 bytes long, and I think are always 04 00

Layer 3: vertical gates

    Cells 1 byte long: 02 (no gate), 03 (gate)

Layer 4: horizontal gates

    Same as layer 3, just when gates are oriented horizontally

Layer 5: via layer

    Cells 1 byte long: 02 (no via), 03 (via)

Layer 6: horizontal silicon connections

    Cells 1 byte long: 02 (no connection), 03 (connection between this
    cell and the one on the right)

Layer 7: vertical silicon connections

    Same as Layer 6, just vertical.  Connection between this cell and
    the one below it.

Layer 8: horizontal metal connections
Layer 9: vertical metal connections

    Yeah same idea again, just for metal this time
